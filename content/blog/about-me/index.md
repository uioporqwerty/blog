I'm Nitish Sachar. I live in California. I love to write code and have written code for mobile apps and web apps primarily in C# and the .NET stack.

This blog is created using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The name for the blog is Nybble because it stands for a half byte as described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibble). The site icon in the tab is Nibbler from Futurama :)
